Because of its statistical and graphical capabilities, R has become part of the
actuarial toolkit. However, actuaries often lack systematic training in
efficient data manipulation in R.

In this session, we will review fundamental R data structures and their
application to insurance data. Participants will learn to perform basic
actuarial procedure using modern data manipulation librairies (tidyverse).

Five modules will cover different aspects of a reserving and ratemaking
workflow (policy/claim data manipulation, rating, loss development,
indications), with examples taken from CAS Exam 5 study notes (Werner, Appendix
C). In each module, participants will discuss practical R programming problems
in small groups.

Participants will gain a better grasp of R data structures and their
application to insurance data. They will be able to script data manipulation
pipelines to perform routine actuarial procedures.

Participants should have basic programming skills (not necessarily in R) and
some experience performing basic actuarial procedures.
