## Denis Dreano

- Pricing actuary @Swiss Re since 2018
- Currently, Lead Actuarial Models and Architecture
- Focus on Data Models for actuarial applications
- Writing actuarial R applications and packages
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-dreano/)

## Why this Workshop

* Programming is part of the actuarial profession
* Lack of Formal Training in Programming Techniques
* Inefficient workflows

## Learning Objectives

* Select the most appropriate R data structure to represent different types of actuarial concepts: vector, list, data frame, array, date, etc.
* Write R scripts that load, manipulate and export insurance data, using state-of-the-art libraries: tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate, purrr, etc.
* Perform simple standard actuarial procedures in R: aggregate claim/policy data, calculate summary ratios, calculate and develop claim triangles, etc.

## Goal

Reproduce parts of realistic actuarial process:

* Automobile Rate Indication
  - Appendix A from Werner and Modlin, *Basic Ratemaking*. 
    - `References/Werner Basic Ratemaking - Appendix A - Auto Indication.pdf`
  - Excel version:
    - `References/Appendix A - Auto Indication.xlsx`

By the end of the session:

* Better understanding of the R language and modern libraries
* Understanding of modeling and manipulation fe

It will allow you to:

* Be more efficient when programming in R
* Automate more of your workflow
* Collaborate more effectively with application developers and data engineers

## Disclaimers

* Expect some level of programming experience R or other language
  - R refresher in `Slides/R_basics.pdf`
* I recommend using RStudio for the workshop
  - Some notes in `Slides/RStudio_basics.pdf`
* Will focus on the data and data manipulation
  - No coverage of charting libraries or building applications

## Organization

Three parts:

* 12:30 Module 1: Rate Indication
* 13:30 Module 2: Earned Premium
* 14:30 Module 3: Claim Development
* 15:30 Discussion and Conclusion

Each module will be organized as follows:

* 10 minutes of introduction
* 40 minutes of exercises
  - Open the "question" R scripts in `Workshop/` folder
  - Try to solve the questions individually or in a small group
  - Don't spend too much time on each question. After 5 minute look at the "solution" script and move on to the next question.
* 10 minutes of discussions

## Resources

* `Data/`: Raw data you will need to 
* `References/`: Original source for the rate indication
* `Slides/`: This slide and other resources
* `Videos/`
* `Workshop/`: The exercises and the solutions
