## Refresh your R skills

Make sure you are comfortable with the basic syntax of R:

- assignment (`<-`)
- functions
- control structures (if, else, for, while)
- basic operations (+, -, *, /, ^)
- logical operators (<, >, ==, !=, &, |)
- missing values (`NA`)

If you're not familiar with RStudio, check out:

* this 6-minute video [RStudio for the Total Beginner](https://youtu.be/FIrsOBy5k58?si=OTpgpTeNd3Gux1bF)
* The RStudio cheatsheet in the `Cheatsheets/` folder

If you need a refresher, I included a short R tutorial in the `Slides/` folder
of the workshop material.
