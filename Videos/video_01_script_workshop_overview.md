Hi my name is Denis. I'm an actuary specializing in actuarial data models and tools.

On May 5th I will be leading a workshop on
R for actuarial applications, focusing on fundamentals on
data maninupation and data structures.

In this video I will give you quick presentation on what the session
will cover and what it won't cover, so that you can make an
informed choice on whether you want to attend it.

Let me first go into what this won't cover:

* This is not an introduction to programming or to the R language
  - If you have good programming skills in another language it's ok, 
  - make sure to look at have a look at the **R primer**
* Need to have some basic understanding of rate indications and claim development
  - Basic at exam 5 level
* Won't cover anything making plots, tables, reports, applications
  - Would be an entire workshop by itself

*Focus on data and data manipulation at an intermediary level*
Why?

In my xp more and more actuaries learn R 
limited to solve a few use cases (fitting distributions, adv modeling)
Excel first workflow
Do in R whatever can't do in Excel

- Not most efficien
- Miss out on opportunities to automate
- Cannot think like a programmer
    - cannot communicate efficiently with developers and DE

In this workshop:

- Practical example of an actuarial workflow typically performed in XL
    - Rate indication with loss development, Exam 5
- Think: how can we do the same calculations with R?
- Specifically focus on three parts:
    1. The rate indication itself: calculating the projected LR
    2. Load a policy dataset and calculate the earned premium
    3. Perform loss development with CL

Along the way we will learn about:
  * different data strcutures in R and which one you should use for what
    - vectors, matrices, data frames, lists
  * how to manipulate data with
    - dplyr, purrr, lubridate, 

The goal is get you started on the journey to the next level of R programming skill. Specifically:
  * Confidently choose the right structure for your data
  * Get an idea of the most important R libraries for data manipulation

In conclusion, if interested:

- I will be posting more videos to present the session in greater details
- and how to get prepared for it

so stay tuned and see you soon. Bye bye!
